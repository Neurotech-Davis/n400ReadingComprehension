# n400ReadingComprehension

This project tried to utilize eye tracking, EEG data, and an LLM to provide assistance while reading. Specific characteristics of eye tracking, such as prolonged eye movement and regression, combined with cognitive load extracted from OpenBCI EEG data, allows the model to accurately locate incomprehensible text within a passage. The LLM then poses tailored feedback to support reader comprehension.

We only got through the preprocessing for the n400 signals.
